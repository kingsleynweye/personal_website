I am a PhD student in the [Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering](https://www.caee.utexas.edu) at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) and a researcher in the [Intelligent Environments Laboratory](https://www.ie-lab.org) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Zoltan Nagy](https://www.caee.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/nagy). I also, serve as a Graduate Research Assistant for [Utility and Energy Management](https://utilities.utexas.edu) at UT.

My research interests include occupant-centric control of HVAC systems, energy flexibility of Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings and the use of reinforcement learning for building energy systems control towards building electrification and decarbonization. I have participated in the organization of the [ACM SIGEnergy workshop on Reinforcement Learning for energy management in buildings and cities (RLEM)](http://www.rlem-workshop.net) at ACM BuildSys and I am the Co-President of [TexASHRAE](https://sites.utexas.edu/ashrae/), the [American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)](https://www.ashrae.org) UT Student Branch.

I was born in [Ahoada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahoada) but spent most of my formative years in the garden city of [Port Harcourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt). I moved to the United States for college and have somewhat stuck around since then :slightly_smiling_face:. I am a sucker for good [afrobeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrobeats) and [bashment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehall) DJ mixes on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kingsley-nweye), cheap wine, Guinness and [jollof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice). You might find me building LEGOs or weightlifting in the gym when I convince myself that I have nothing left on my Trello board.
