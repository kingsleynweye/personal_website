I am Mechanical Engineer at [Jacobs](https://www.jacobs.com) where I get to contribute to thermal energy generation decarbonization through utility-scale geothermal cooling and heating modelling, building energy performance modelling and software development for utility master planning.

I hold a BSE in Mechanical Engineering from University of South Carolina, Columbia, and a PhD in Civil Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin (UT) where I was a researcher in the [Intelligent Environments Laboratory](https://www.ie-lab.org) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Zoltan Nagy](https://www.ie-lab.org/author/zoltan-nagy/). My research has been awarded at the [IBPSA-USA SimBuild 2024](https://ibpsa.us/simbuild-2024-celebrating-two-decades/) and [ACM BuildSys 2023](https://buildsys.acm.org/2023/) conferences. I also, worked as a Graduate Research Assistant for [Utility and Energy Management](https://utilities.utexas.edu) at UT developing the backend and cloud infrastructure for the [UT Energy Hub](https://utenergyhub.utilities.utexas.edu/login).

I served as the Co-President of [TexASHRAE](https://sites.utexas.edu/ashrae/), the [American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)](https://www.ashrae.org) UT Student Branch, and co-led the organization of The CityLearn Challenge [2022](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2022-citylearn-challenge) and [2023](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2023-citylearn-challenge).

On a personal note, I was born in [Ahoada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahoada) but spent most of my formative years in the Garden City of [Port Harcourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt). I moved to the United States for college and have somewhat stuck around since then :slightly_smiling_face:. I currently live in Austin, Texas and enjoy walking/running the [Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail](https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Parks/GIS/AnnRoyButlerTrailUpdate.pdf). I am a sucker for good [afrobeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrobeats) and [bashment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehall) DJ mixes on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kingsley-nweye), and a cold pint of Guinness. You might find me building LEGOs, walking trails or weightlifting when I convince myself that I have nothing left on my Trello board.

<!-- I had spent my Summer 2024 interning  where I learned about the engineering design work that goes into building thermal energy networks as well as the efforts required for campus and district master planning. It was a great opportunity to also develop my energy modeling and software development skills, while learning from the engineer's at the [world's number one design firm](https://www.enr.com/toplists/2023-top-500-design-firms-preview)! -->

<!-- Born in [Ahoada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahoada), in the southern part of Nigeria, I am of the [Ekpeye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekpeye_people) and [Igbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igbo_people) tribes. I spent most of my formative years in the garden city of [Port Harcourt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Harcourt) but moved to the United States for college and have somewhat stuck around since then :slightly_smiling_face:. I am a sucker for good [afrobeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrobeats) and [bashment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancehall) DJ mixes on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kingsley-nweye), cheap wine, Guinness and [jollof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice) rice. You might find me building LEGOs or weightlifting in the gym when I convince myself that I have nothing left on my Trello board. -->

<!-- My research interests include occupant-centric control of distributed energy resources, energy flexibility of grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) and the use of reinforcement learning for building energy systems control towards building electrification and decarbonization.  -->
