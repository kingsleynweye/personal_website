	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused lifestyle changes and has led to the new electricity demand patterns in the presence of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as work-from-home policy and lockdown. Quantifying the effect on electricity demand is critical for future electricity market planning yet challenging in the context of limited smart metered buildings, which leads to limited understanding of the temporal and spatial variations in building energy use. This study uses a large scale private smart meter electricity demand data from the City of Austin, combined with publicly available environmental data, and develops an ensemble regression model for long term daily electricity demand prediction. Using 15-min resolution data from over 400,000 smart meters from 2018 to 2020 aggregated by building type and zip code, our proposed model precisely formalizes the counterfactual universe in the without COVID-19 scenario. The model is used to understand building electricity demand changes during the pandemic and to identify relationships between such changes and socioeconomic patterns. Results indicate the increase in residential usage , demonstrating the spatial redistribution of energy consumption during the work-from-home period. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework by assessing multiple socioeconomic impacts with the comparison between the counterfactual universe and observations.},

abstract = {Building upon prior research that highlighted the need for standardizing environments for building control research, and inspired by recently introduced challenges for real life reinforcement learning (RL) control, here we propose a non-exhaustive set of nine real world challenges for RL control in grid-interactive buildings (GIBs). We argue that research in this area should be expressed in this framework in addition to providing a standardized environment for repeatability. Advanced controllers such as model predictive control (MPC) and RL control have both advantages and disadvantages that prevent them from being implemented in real world problems. Comparisons between the two are rare, and often biased. By focusing on the challenges, we can investigate the performance of the controllers under a variety of situations and generate a fair comparison. As a demonstration, we implement the offline learning challenge in CityLearn, an OpenAI Gym environment for the easy implementation of RL agents in a demand response setting to reshape the aggregated curve of electricity demand by controlling the energy storage of a diverse set of buildings in a district. We use CityLearn to study the impact of different levels of domain knowledge and complexity of RL algorithms and show that the sequence of operations (SOOs) utilized in a rule based controller (RBC) that provides fixed logs to RL agents during offline training affect the performance of the agents when evaluated on a set of four energy flexibility metrics. Longer offline training from an optimized RBC leads to improved performance in the long run. RL agents that train on the logs from a simplified RBC risk poorer performance as the offline training period increases. We also observe no impact on performance from information sharing amongst agents. We call for a more interdisciplinary effort of the research community to address the real world challenges, and unlock the potential of GIB controllers.}

abstract = {Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring is essential to assess occupant exposure to the wide range of pollutants present in indoor environments. Accurate research-grade monitors are often used to monitor IAQ but the expense and logistics associated with these devices often limits the temporal and spatial scale of monitoring efforts. More affordable consumer-grade sensors – frequently referred to as low-cost sensors – can provide insight into IAQ conditions across greater scales but their accuracy and calibration requirements need further evaluation. In this paper, we present the Building EnVironment and Occupancy (BEVO) Beacon. The BEVO Beacon is entirely open-source, including the software, hardware, and design schematics which are all provided on GitHub. We created 20 of these standalone, stationary devices which measure up to 24 parameters at a one-minute resolution of which we focus on carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, total volatile organic compounds, temperature, and size-resolved particulate matter. We investigated the efficacy of two different calibration approaches – device-specific and environment-averaged – for these sensors as well as also provide an extensive discussion considerations for each of the sensors. Calibrated sensors performed well when compared to reference monitors or calibrated gas standards. The CO sensors yielded the best agreement (r2=0.98-0.99), followed by temperature (r2=0.89-0.99), CO2 (r2=0.62-0.99), and PM2.5 (r2=-0.13-0.91). In all cases, the device-specific calibration approach yielded the most accurate results. We evaluated our devices through a successful 11-week field study where we monitored the IAQ in participants’ bedrooms. The work we present on consumer-grade sensors adds to the existing literature by considering sensor-specific calibration techniques and analysis. The BEVO Beacon adds to the successful line of similarly developed devices by providing an open-source framework that researchers can readily adapt and modify to their own applications.}

In turn, management of these systems can be stressed during population shifts (and corresponding demand shifts), such as those seen during both discrete (e.g.,\&nbsp;hurricanes) and protracted (e.g.,\&nbsp;pandemics) events. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic caused drastic changes in society, consequentially changing spatial and temporal water use as people worked from home. In another example, Winter Storm Uri led to utility service disruptions throughout Texas, causing people without power and water to seek shelter, leading to spatial changes in water use in conjunction with physical damage. This sheltering occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased uncertainty in demand and challenges to shelter while ensuring social distancing. Researchers have studied disaster scenarios independently, but there is a gap surrounding compounding disasters as human-infrastructure interactions are likely altered. Here, we assess water demand changes during Winter Storm Uri (which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic) at the building level. We performed k-means clustering on demand data from four buildings at the University of Texas, Austin. Three buildings showed different daily demand profiles during the storm compared to the spring semester. Interestingly, there were demand increases in buildings not being used as warming centers, perhaps indicating increased occupancy. This trend reveals that people do not necessarily choose to shelter in places that are formally organized. In a museum, water use decreased compared to the already reduced demand during the pandemic, possibly leading to water stagnation and quality concerns. }

abstract = {HVAC systems account for a significant portion of building energy use. Nighttime setback scheduling is an Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) where cooling and heating setpoints are increased and decreased respectively during unoccupied periods with the goal of obtaining energy savings. However, knowledge of a building’s real occupancy is required to maximize the success of this measure. In addition, there is the need for a scalable way to estimate energy savings potential from ECMs that is not limited by building specific parameters and experimental or simulation modeling investments. Here, we propose MARTINI, a sMARt meTer drIveN estImation of occupant-derived Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) schedules and energy savings that leverages the ubiquity of energy smart meters and Wi-Fi infrastructure in commercial buildings. We estimate the schedules by clustering Wi-Fi derived occupancy profiles and, estimate energy savings by shifting ramp-up and setback times observed in typical operational/static load profiles that are obtained by clustering smart meter energy profiles. Our case-study results with five buildings over seven months show an average of 8.1%–10.8% (summer) and 0.2%–5.9% (fall) chilled water energy savings when HVAC system operation is aligned with occupancy. We validate our method with results from Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) and find that estimated average savings of MARTINI are within 0.9%–2.4% of the BEPS predictions. In the absence of occupancy information, we can still estimate potential savings from increasing ramp-up time and decreasing setback start time. In 51 academic buildings, we find savings potentials between 1%–5%.},

abstract = {The occupancy information in buildings is fundamental for smart buildings (e.g., occupant-centric controls). Opportunistic occupancy detection (OOD) uses connection data of mobile devices. While OOD has been developed and applied, one critical drawback is that it requires the ground truth of occupants to calibrate, which is limited to gather. Here, we introduce CROOD: a capture and recapture (CRc) inspired OOD. In ecology, CRc has been established for the estimation of animal populations, when the manual count is impossible. We adopt this unique approach to estimate the number of mobile devices in a building. Then, using a simple estimate on the total population, CROOD determines the relationship between the numbers of occupants and mobile devices. We evaluate CROOD numerically on the synthetic building populations and demonstrate its application in a university library using WiFi connection data. We find that CROOD can estimate the number of mobile devices and subsequently the number of occupants with 1–2 weeks to converge a reasonable accuracy. A long term experiment shows that CROOD can adapt to varying population characteristics (e.g., occupants bring more mobile devices), outperforming the reference sample mean estimator. The real building implementation demonstrates that while in the first 1–2 weeks, the sample mean estimator is superior, eventually CROOD adapts and provides better estimates without ground-truth calibration. Although CROOD has a limitation of building types and systems, our results envision that CROOD could be a viable addition to other OOD methods to better utilize existing mobile device connection data to estimate occupancy in buildings.}
